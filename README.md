💊 Medicine Time
🎯 Goal

Medicine Time is a native Android application developed during my college academic period 🎓 as part of hands-on learning and practical implementation of core Android concepts. The application is designed to help busy and forgetful users remember their daily medications ⏰.

It allows users to store medicine details and set multiple alarms for each pill, with alarms scheduled at specific times and on selected days of the week 📅. Users can view their medicines in a Today view or select a specific date to check scheduled medications 🔍. Additionally, the app maintains a history of medication intake, helping users track their medicine usage over time and stay consistent with their health routine 📊.



Use Cases and What Each Button Does:

In the Home page, you will see 1 buttons in the bottom right of the application. ######Plus sign: This will take you to the Add Activity where you will be able to create an alarm. The application will automatically link up all the alarms to a specific pill with the same Pill Name. If you attempt to create an alarm to a pill that does not exist, it will automatically create a pill object for you. ######Calendar sign: This will take you to the Schedule Activity where you can see all the pills and alarms organized by the day of week.
